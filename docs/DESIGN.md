# DESIGN.md

***NOTE: 2017-07-03: This document is still very much a work in
   progress.  We welcome suggestions on improving it.***

## Overall architecture

The Provider Screening Module is a Java EE Enterprise Application
using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage builds, [the Spring
framework](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) for core web
application functionality (including providing an API),
[Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/) for Object Relational Mapping
(interacting with the database), and [jBPM](http://www.jbpm.org/) and
[Drools](http://drools.org/) for business rules management. See
[`DEPENDENCIES.md`](DEPENDENCIES.md) and [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md)
for more details on component versions and installation requirements.

## UI Templates

Originally, the PSM used
[JSP](http://www.caucho.com/resin-3.1/doc/jsp-templates.xtp) templates,
as detailed in [issue
#238](https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/psm/issues/238#issuecomment-313217566).
We have converted some of these JSP templates to
[Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/), for easier reuse.  Mustache
templates can be used with code written in any number of languages, not
just Java.  For this reason, they are not as exactly tuned to Java
development.  JSPs are able to hold more complex logic than Mustache,
and work well for the PSM's screens, which are so specific that they are
unlikely to be reused.  The framing templates of the PSM (the headers,
footers, and navigation bar) have been converted to Mustache, since they
are the most likely to be reused in other applications or in pieces of
the PSM that might be written in another language.

As part of this conversion, we deduplicated many of the templates.  When
you are editing a piece of UI functionality, it should appear in either
a JSP template or a Mustache template.  Use the correct formatting for
whichever style applies.

## Interfaces

***NOTE:2017-07-03: [We no longer use `ext-sources-app` and are
   rewriting this section
   accordingly.](https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/psm/issues/165).***

The two pieces of this application (`psm-app` and `ext-sources-app`)
communicate via a web service which is provided by the `ext-sources-app`.
Let's call that the External Sources Services (ESS).  The ESS takes
return XML, which is handled by
[javax.jws](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/jws/package-summary.html)
(this takes serializable Java objects and converts them to XML).

Take `AccreditedBirthCentersLicenseService` as a typical example of these
web services:

The client steps are marked CLIENT below -- paths referenced in these
items are all rooted on `psm-app`.  The ESS steps are marked ESS -- paths
referenced in these items are all rooted on `ext-sources-app`.

1.  CLIENT: The core application defines the interactions with the
    service in `cms.externalsources.drl`
    (`cms-business-processes/src/main/resources/cms.externalsources.drl`)

2.  CLIENT:  The request parameters are translated to XML before being sent to
    the server, the translation is defined in
    `accredited_birth_center_req.xml`
    (`services/src/main/resources/xslt/accredited_birth_center_res.xsl`)

3.  ESS: The request arrives at the appropriate endpoint.  The endpoint has
    been defined in `cxf-servlet.xml`
    (`startup-war/WebContent/WEB-INF/cxf-servlet.xml`  lines 14-17)

4.  ESS: The request is translated from XML to parameters and routed to the
    service implementation (also defined in `cxf-servlet`) which is defined
    in `AccreditedBirthCentersLicenseServiceImpl.java`
    (`services/src/main/java/gov/medicaid/screening/services/impl/AccreditedBirthCentersLicenseServiceImpl.java`)

5.  ESS: The service calls the DAO which handles the search itself.  In this
    case `AccreditedBirthCentersLicenseDAOBean.java`
    (`services/src/main/java/gov/medicaid/screening/dao/impl/AccreditedBirthCentersLicenseDAOBean.java`)
    -- this hits up the third party service to try to pull down data.
    
6.  ESS: The result is passed as a simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object),
    whose structure is defined in `AccreditedBirthCenter.java`
    (`services/src/main/java/gov/medicaid/entities/AccreditedBirthCenter.java`)
    
7.  ESS: The POJO is converted to XML by basic Java libraries
    (`javax.jws`), and then returned back to the client.

8.  CLIENT: The client translates the XML into a POJO via
    `accredited_birth_center_res.xsl`
    (`psm-app/services/src/main/resources/xslt/accredited_birth_center_res.xsl`)

There is no documentation of the data structures yet.  The other
services all appear to follow a similar pattern in the structure of the
application.  Each POJO for each endpoint is unique; they share no
common superclass.

This all means that the API is currently brittle; it hasn't been
engineered or documented (see [this
milestone](https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/psm/milestone/4)), and
writing a client for it isn't predictable (you would have to look at the
POJO to know what kind of return to expect).

The `ejb-jar.xml` file is used within ESS functionality, not for the
actual webservice definition.  It defines the custom URL config
parameter (`mita/config/URL`) so that it contains the URL of that bean's
associated third party application.  That variable is used in the DAO's
superclass
(`services/src/main/java/gov/medicaid/screening/dao/impl/BaseDAO.java` --
see line 102) which uses it to make the actual call to the external
service.  In the case of our AccreditedBirthCenters the
`ext-sources-app/services/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml` defines
the service as
[http://www.birthcenteraccreditation.org/find-accredited-birth-centers](http://www.birthcenteraccreditation.org/find-accredited-birth-centers).


## User types

The PSM has four types of users, each with their own permission level:

1. __Service agent__
    
    Service agents should be able to create, view, and edit enrollments
    for their provider clients.

    - Can view: provider dashboard, enrollments, profile
    - Can create an enrollment
    - Can edit draft enrollments
    - Can view submitted enrollments
    
2. __Service admin__
    
    This user type can edit and view enrollments just as a service agent
    can, but it can also edit provider types and the screening schedule.
    This user type is most likely appropriate for someone working for a
    state and overseeing enrollment and service agents.
    
    - Can view: provider dashboard and enrollments
    
    - Functions:
        - View and edit provider types
        - Edit screening schedule
        - Add and edit help topics
        - Add and edit agreements/addendums
        - View, create, edit, and delete other service agents

3. __System admin__
    
    This user type is purely for managing users, which none of the other
    user types can do.
    
    - Can only view "user account" screen
    - Functions
        - Create, edit, and delete users
        - Edit the abilities of user roles, but doesn't seem to be able
          to create new roles

4. __Providers__
    
    The user type with the lowest level of permissions, a provider
    should only be able to create, view, and edit their own enrollments.

    - View own enrollments
    - Create and edit enrollments
